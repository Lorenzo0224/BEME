# BEME
This Project focus on exploring BERT-based Entity Matching model Explanations, based on two Deep Learning models(Ditto and JointBERT).
The code are fully contributed by Polaris, a master student from our group. This project was actually her bachelor graduation project at the time.
The methodology of this project has already been accepted by our Journal of Software 2023 paper 'Research on Intepretability of Pre-trained Language Model-based Entity Matching'.
We will try to integrate BEME into our data integration pipeline in the near future.
