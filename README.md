# BEME
This Project is our early exploration on BERT-based Entity Matching model Explanations.
The code are contributed by Polaris, a master from our group. This project was actually her graduation project at the time.
The methodology of this project has already been accepted by Journal of Software 2023.
We will try to integrate BEME into our data integration pipeline in the near future.
