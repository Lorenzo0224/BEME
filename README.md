# BEME
This Project focus on exploring BERT-based Entity Matching model Explanations, focusing on two SOTA model(Ditto and JointBERT).
The code are contributed by Polaris, a master from our group. This project was actually her graduation project at the time.
The methodology of this project has already been accepted by our Journal of Software 2023 paper 'Research on Intepretability of Pre-trained Language Model-based Entity Matching'.
We will try to integrate BEME into our data integration pipeline in the near future.
